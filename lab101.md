# Splunk Observability Suite GDI: 101

Goals:

- Learn how to deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector on Linux via UI wizard
- Learn how to modify the configuration of OTel Collector
- Learn how to configure a smartagent receiver (for Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring)
- Learn how to modify the configuration of Fluentd (for Splunk Log Observer)
- Learn how to instrument an application to emit spans (for Splunk APM)
- Learn how to instrument a JS page to emit data (for Splunk RUM)

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have followed the [repository
README](https://github.com/flands/o11y-gdi-workshop/blob/master/README.md) for
initial configuration.

> WARNING: To make things easier in the workshop we will be using the `latest`
> tag of Docker images. This is not recommended in production for a variety of
> reasons including potential changes to behavior on container restart.

Given you may already have some images locally and this lab required very
recent versions of the images, let's clean up the ones we care about locally:

```bash
docker rmi -f quay.io/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector \
    okhttp >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
```

For the instrumentation parts of this workshop we need to prepare some items
locally that take several minutes to complete. Let's kick off the process now.
Please open a separate terminal, `cd` into the o11y-gdi-workshop directory and run:

```bash
cd demo-app && ./bootstrap.sh && cd ..
```

Continue with this lab while the above command runs.

## Deploy Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector for Linux via UI wizard

> WARNING: Using the Linux installer script is NOT supported or recommended for
> containerized Linux environments (e.g. Docker). This is because the installer
> script requires systemd and for security reasons, containers do not have
> permission to run systemd. This is purely for demonstration purposes to see
> how the installer script works. Directions on the supported way to deploy on
> Docker can be found
> [here](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linux-standalone.md#docker).

Run (replace `${USER}` if needed):

```bash
$ sudo docker run --name docker-${USER} -p 55679:55679 -p 9411:9411 -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --privileged -d jrei/systemd-ubuntu
$ docker exec -it docker-${USER} /bin/bash
```

> IMPORTANT: If you stop the container (`docker stop <containerName>`), which
> you should do at the end of this workshop, the state in the container will be
> lost.

Within the container run:

```bash
$ apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl sudo vim
```

Go to the [Splunk Observability Suite UI > Data Sources >
Linux](https://app.signalfx.com/o11y/#/integrations) and follow the wizard
pasting the commands into container terminal window.

> IMPORTANT: The last step of the wizard is not functional at this time. This
> is a known issue and will be fixed before GA.

That's it! You have successfully deployed the `splunk-otel-collector` and
`td-agent` services. Metrics and logs should automatically start being
collected and sent to the suite. Please confirm you see data on both the
Dashboards and Log Observer pages for your given container.

- For `Infrastructure Monitoring` add a filter for `host`. The value can be
  found by running the `hostname` command within your container. Note there may
  be a delay up to a minute for initial data to start appearing.

Bonus: Run the following command:

```bash
$ sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --help
```

Notice there are more configuration options available including the ability to
not install Fluentd (e.g. if you are not using Log Observer).

## Change the default configuration

Why might you want to change the default configuration? Many reasons:

- Some receivers are not needed (remove for security reasons)
- Need to configure one or more processors (e.g. attributes process to add `environment` attribute)
- Need to configure an additional log source
- Need to configure multiline parsing of a log source

If you use the Linux installer, where is the configuration for
`splunk-otel-collector` and `td-agent` stored?

(Hint: the installer output tells you...but otherwise check the [installer getting started
documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/getting-started/linux-installer.md).)

Let's modify some configs!

### Enable the logging exporter with debug logs

> **WARNING:** Debug logging is very verbose and will result in increased resource
> utilization. Only enable debug logging when you are actively troubleshooting an
> issue.

Why? Because the logging exporter is great for troubleshooting and enabling
debug logs can help get you comfortable changing the collector configuration.

How? The collector [troubleshooting
guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
contains this information. Only enable the logging exporter for the tracing
pipeline for now. (Reminder: you need to configure the logging exporter and
enabling it in at least one pipeline!)

Once enabled and the collector restarted, you can send some [synthetic
data](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
to confirm it is working.

### Disable the Jaeger receiver

Why? By default the Splunk OpenTelemetry Connector enables a [variety of
receivers](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/security.md)
to make it easy to collect data from both greenfield and brownfield
environments. Depending on the environment, some receivers may not be needed.
Let's assume Jaeger is not used within the environment and as such we wish to
remove the Jaeger receiver.

How? Check the
[documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/). Look
for Jaeger in the configuration file and try to figure it out. Questions to
think about:

- Do you need to remove it from the `receivers:` section? Why or why not?
- Is removing it from the `receivers:` section enough? Why or why not?
- In addition to the collector configuration, what other configuration may need to change?

### Enable the ntp smartagent receiver

Why? To see how Smart Agent monitors can be used with the Splunk OpenTelemetry
Connector.

How? See the [Smart Agent receiver
documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/internal/receiver/smartagentreceiver)
and the [ntp monitor
documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/master/docs/monitors/ntp.md)

Once enabled and the collector restarted, confirm that `ntp.offset_seconds`
metric is being collected. Consider enabling the logging exporter in the
collector's metrics pipeline to test this. If you do, disable once done
confirming.

### Add an environment tag to spans for Splunk APM

Why? Environments provide a way to view your data. For example, you may have
the same services in your staging and production environments, but you want to
view the data between the two environments separately.

How? The collector provides one or more processors that can be configured to do
things including CRUD operations on metadata. Span tags are called attributes
in OpenTelemetry and the collector offers an attributes processor. Configure it
to add `environment=<yourUsername>`. (Hint: already commented out in config
just needs to be enabled!)

Once enabled and the collector restarted, you can send some [synthetic
trace data](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
to confirm it is working. Given the logging exporter was previously configured
you can check the collector logs to verify the environment attribute is added.

Bonus: Adding environment information to logs for Splunk Observer can also be
beneficial. Update the configuration to also add this information to logs.

### Add a custom source to the Fluentd configuration

Why? Because you may have logs writing to a location that Fluentd is not
configured to monitor by default. Examples of this would be applications that
do not log to standard log locations like journald, /var/log, or Windows Event
Viewer.

How? Create a custom source configuration in the `conf.d/` direction. Have it
monitor `/var/log/test.log`. (Hint: look at other source configurations and
remember the SPLUNK label is critical!)

Once configured and Fluentd restarted, you can send some [synthetic
trace data](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
to confirm it is working. Consider enabling the logging exporter in the
collector's log pipeline to test this.

## Instrument an application to emit data

We will instrument a Java application using Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry Java.
Read the
[documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java) to learn how
to get started. The `java` command can be found in
`demo-app/tracing-examples/signalfx-tracing/runJava.sh`. Modify this file as
appropriate to enable auto-instrumentation (note the location of the
javaagent JAR file can be found in `okhttp-and-jedis.Dockerfile`).

Now that everything is configured, let's start the application.

> Note: This application will send to your running container with
> splunk-otel-collector.

```bash
cd demo-app/tracing-examples/signalfx-tracing/
docker run -e OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://0.0.0.0:14268/api/traces -d okhttp ./runJava.sh
```

The application will take a few seconds to come up. Once the application is
up, you should start seeing logs from the splunk-otel-collector.

> **Note:** Be sure to shut down all containers when you are done else they will
> consume resources and battery life. You can confirm everything is turned off by
> running `docker ps`.

## Instrument a JS page to emit data

> WARNING: Manually adding JS code to a web application is for demonstration
> purposes only! In addition, be aware that ad blockers and other extensions
> can prevent the JS code from running properly so consider doing this in an
> incognito window.

The following directions are for Chrome, but equivalent capabilities are
available in other browsers. Go to the website of your choice -- for example
https://google.com. Right-click on the page and select Inspect. Configure
overrides as described
[here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#overrides).

On the Sources tab, select `(index)`. Click immediately after `<head>` in
index.html and paste in the code snippet from the [getting started
documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-js-web#getting-started).
Ensure the `beaconUrl`, `rumAuth`, `app` parameters are properly
configured.

> IMPORTANT: `rumAuth` is a RUM specific token. Admins can create it in the UI
> like other access tokens. A `RUM workshop` token has already been created
> that you can use.

Once done, right-click on `(index.html)` and select `Save for overrides`.
Refresh the page and ensure no errors. Go to RUM in the UI and you should
immediately start seeing data!
